    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Base:
        <ul>
            <li>A packet of cookies.</li>
            <li>A tablespoon of melted butter</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Black Coat:
        <ul>
            <li>250 g dark chocolate for desserts.</li>
            <li>A sachet of curd</li>
            <li>200ml milk</li>
            <li>200ml cream</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Brown Layer:
        <ul>
            <li>250 g milk chocolate.</li>
            <li>A sachet of curd</li>
            <li>200ml milk</li>
            <li>200ml cream</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>White Coat:
        <ul>
            <li>250 g white chocolate.</li>
            <li>A sachet of curd</li>
            <li>200ml milk</li>
	        <li>200ml cream</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Elaboration</h2>

<ol>
    <li>First of all, prepare the base: Crush the biscuits with the chopped butter. Pour it into a springform 
    mold, spreading it very well all over its base, and put it in the oven for a few minutes to get hard 
    and crispy.</li>

    <li>Heat the milk and cream, add the chopped dark chocolate and when it is dissolved, add the curd... Leave it over a low heat, stirring non-stop for 7 minutes, making sure it does not boil. It is then followed by
    Tip over the biscuit base.</li>

    <li>Then do the same with the milk chocolate and pour it on top of the dark chocolate. To prevent a hole from being made over the previous mixture, break the cascade by dropping the liquid onto a spoon.
    And then you do the same thing with white chocolate...</li>
</ol>
